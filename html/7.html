    <!-- Element Description
1. <address>	The <address> HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.
2. <article>	The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.
3. <aside>	The <aside> HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
4. <footer>	The <footer> HTML element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
5. <header>	The <header> HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
6. <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>	The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.
7. <main>	The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
8. <nav>	The <nav> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
9. <section>	The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions. -->
